# Guess-My-Number

<h1>Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>This is a simple game i made while watching an Udemy Course about how to become an Expert in JS from zero level. <br>

The purpose of this game is to guess what's the right number, you have 20 guesses left to set a <b>NEW</b> high score on the board.<br>
You must choose numbers between 1 and 20. ( 0 is not included ðŸ˜¶) <br>

Everytime you guess the wrong number, your score goes down by 1. <br><br>
The highest score you can get is 20 and the lowest is 0. If you will run out of available guesses ,you can play again by clicking on the <b><i>Again!</i></b> button!
<br> 
<h2>!How to play the game!</h2>
<br>
Here we have the main screen of the game. <br> <br>
Highscore has been set 0.

<br> <br>

Let's insert a number here in this area, press the <b><i>Check!</i></b> button and see what we've got. (Example: I'm inserting number 4) <br><br>

As we can see, a couple of things have changed after we clicked on the <b><i>Check!</i></b> button. <br> 
<ul>
  <li>Score has decreased by 1 because guessed wrong.</li>
  <li>And the number you've guessed is lower than the right one</li>
</ul>
 <br>

 Let's make another guess, this time a higher number. (Example: Number 18) <br><br>

As we can see, we have guessed a wrong number again which is higher than the right one this time. <br> <br>
